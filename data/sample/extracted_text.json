The historic vessel, Mistral II, is currently being restored by the Trust, providing\njob skills training to young Tasmanians, after which she will join Windeward Bound as a sail training\nvessel.\nThe Windeward Bound Trust is funded mainly by operational income, the generous donations of\nthe supporting public, and continuing support of our sponsors. 100% of all income received\nremains in the Trust to meet the costs of operating the ship and to provide scholarships for those in\nmost need.\nIt is the Board's intention that in the years ahead, the ship's operating and maintenance costs will\ngradually be met by increased donor streams thereby enabling the Windeward Bound Trust to\nincrease the number of voyage berths for those in most need, and reduce the current dependence\non commercial activities. To this end, the Windeward Bound Foundation Ltd is an approved DGR\n(class 1) charity registered with the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian charities and Not\nFor Profit Commission.\n\u201cThe Windeward Bound Trust, established in 1993, is committed to the relief of\nhelplessness, the development of work and social skills and the delivery of personal\ngrowth experiences for young people.\u201d\nOUR MISSION\nThe brigantine \"Windeward Bound\" is a 33 metre symbol of enterprise and commitment to provide\nyouth with an opportunity to enjoy and learn skills otherwise out of their reach.\n"

The vessel is named after Lewis Winde, the builder of an 1848\nBoston schooner on which Windeward Bound was modelled. It is constructed almost\nentirely of Tasmanian eucalypt, huon pine and Oregon pine, recycled from old boats and\nbuildings. The hull is constructed of 5 cm hardwood strip planks, over epoxy-laminated\ndouglas fir frames, spaced 38 cm (15 inches) apart. The stem, sternpost and keel are of\nepoxy-laminated Tasmanian blue gum and the decks are of huon and New Zealand\nkauri pines.\nWindeward Bound is rigged with four square sails, three headsails, three staysails\nbetween the masts, a gaff mainsail and gaff topsail, totalling 12 sails in all. The total sail\narea is 402 m2 (4,330 sq ft) and the windage lever of the sails from the centre of lateral\nresistance is 9.87 m.\nShe is commonly used for training youth (of any age) to sail, offering training and\nvoyages that last from anywhere between an hour or two to many weeks. In\n2002\u20132003, the ship and her crew embarked on a successful circumnavigation voyage\naround Australia to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the first circumnavigation,\ncharting and naming of the continent of Australia by Matthew Flinders.[1] During this\nvoyage, the crew docked in most Australian ports and coastal communities, with the\nhelp of Coastcare, to spread the message for individuals and organisations to become\nactively involved in ground works to protect and manage coastal and marine\nenvironments.\n"

The training ship Zebu, which\ncircumnavigated the Earth as part of Operation Raleigh, is an example of a schooner\nbrig.\nDifferences from brig\nThe word brig is an 18th-century shortening of the word brigantine, but to mean a\ndifferent type of rigging. The gaff-rigged mainsail on a brigantine distinguishes it from\nthe brig, which is principally square-rigged on both masts. In addition to the different sail\nconfiguration, the brigantine's mainmast is made from two parts and equal to that of a\nschooner, a quite long mast and a top mast. The mainmast of a brig is made from three\nparts and equal to that of a fully rigged ship - a mast, topmast, and topgallant mast. With\nthe advent of modern (metal) pole masts, this last difference typically no longer exists.\nHISTORY\n\"Windeward Bound\" was conceived in 1965 when a young sailor in the Royal Australian Navy stood\non the shores of Garden Island and watched the arrival in Sydney, from England, of an old Baltic\ntrading vessel known as \"New Endeavour\". This approaching vision began a dream to build and\noperate a similar Tall Ship. A period of service in the RAN and, later, the rigours of acquiring the\nskills as a Joiner/Cabinet maker and a young and growing family, saw the dream left on the shelf for\na while. However, even on the shelf, the dream grew and became all encompassing and a search\nstarted for a suitable set of plans, slipways were haunted studying hull shapes and old time boat\nbuilders were quizzed for their all important information on \"how do you\u2026\"\n"

Suddenly there was no reason to leave the\nproject on the shelf any more. After almost a year of further searching and research, the full size line\ndrawings were found at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. The Americans readily agreed\nto the use of the plans on a commitment that we would sail the ship to Boston someday.\nMuch work followed, measurements were painstakingly lifted off the manuscript, a Naval Architect\nchecked her stability and sailing qualities, full size loftings were drawn up on 52 sheets of white\npainted plywood and the search began to start accumulating materials. Fortunately, I was working\nas an Art director in the advertising world and I was dispatched to sea on the famous \"Eye of the\nWind\" for a photographic shoot, where upon I discovered that \"the Eye\" was almost all recycled\n"

With the ability to use recycled materials, and with absolutely no money (or for\nthat matter, budget) the approval of the survey authority was quickly sought, and as quickly, given.\nThen with the assistance of several volunteers (who thought the project was so crazy, it might just\nwork) and with the blessed absence in Hobart of recycling firms, together with the presence of\nseveral old timber ships awaiting demolition, acquisition of materials began.\nThis process took almost 5 years, and while underway, much other work was accomplished having\nconstruction plans drawn, sponsorship was sought, but not obtained as, at that stage, it was still a\ndream. In 1990, the first of the many blessings came our way. A very large timber warehouse, on\nthe waterfront, and belonging to one of my major clients, ceased being used. Negotiations began\nand slowly they warmed to the idea and then agreed to make it available to build the ship inside as\na form of sponsorship. The keel was finally laid at the end of June 1990, using the last $1,000.00 in\nthe bank to buy the steel. As the days, weeks and months went past, all the recycled timber was\ncleaned up and machined to the various required dimensions and slowly laminated into place by\nthe growing band of volunteers.\nAt the end of 1992, we were horrified to discover that Hobart, along with the rest of Australia, had a\ngrowing problem with disadvantaged youths, young offenders and \"youth at risk\" who were not\nresponding to the usual offerings designed to keep them out of trouble At about the same time, we\ndiscovered an apparently successful youth group known as Project Hahn, loosely modelled on the\nfamous Outward Bound movement. PH used wilderness adventure based therapy to create a level\nof self esteem and personal growth. Studies of UK, European and United States based sail training\norganisations, along with that of New Zealand, led us to the realisation that this was a possible\nanswer to assisting these young people who were otherwise falling through the cracks. Thus, the\nWindeward Bound Trust was formed and sail training for young people became our target. It was\nour belief that no young person should be denied the opportunity and it was resolved to specifically\ntarget the disadvantaged, whether disadvantaged by financial, social or other circumstances.\nWord quickly spread, and within months we had a small group of nervous, but otherwise extremely\nstreetwise young people, male and female, hard at work alongside our adult volunteers assisting\nwith the construction. They were soon joined by a number of others, most of whom stayed with the\nship through her launch, fitout and early sailing days.\n"

I loved learning more\nabout the unique and entertaining members of the Red Watch as I travelled.\nI was amazed by how well I handled everything on this trip, including the dreaded 12 am to 4 am\nshift, the hectic timetable, and the demanding jobs. I completed every job that was entrusted to me\nwith patience and care. My watch did well on the last day's activity and when we had to handle all\nthe tasks necessary to get the boat ready and on the move or keeping the ship safe when we were\nanchored, thanks to my fantastic team. Our trip was fortunate since the weather wasn't too severe,\nthe waves weren't too bad when we passed through the Bass Strait, and we were lucky to witness\nvarious species, including many dolphins, almost every day. My highlights from the wildlife were the\nfish flying into the galley, the sleeping seals, and being able to see the bioluminescence in the\nocean. My team fared well when learning all the ropes, knots, and calls for the sails.\n"

This voyage has been\nnothing short of a revelation, not only in terms of sailing expertise but also in the realm of\nleadership, teamwork, and self-discovery.\nAs I reflect on the challenges we faced and the lessons we learned under the vast expanse of open\nskies and open water, it is evident that this experience has not only equipped me with valuable\nnautical skills but has also imbued me with a deeper understanding of leadership and the power of\ncollaboration.\nThe art of sailing, with its intricate rigging, navigation, and seamanship, has become a metaphor for\nlife itself\u2014a dynamic journey marked by adaptability, resilience, and the continuous pursuit of\nexcellence. The interplay of wind and waves, the teamwork required to hoist and trim sails, and the\nnavigation through unforeseen challenges have all contributed to a holistic understanding of\nleadership, where communication, decisiveness, and trust are the guiding stars.\nThis journey, marked by resistance turned resonance, serves as a powerful reminder that\nsometimes, the most extraordinary experiences lie just beyond our comfort zones. As I carry the\nlessons and memories of this program forward into my future endeavours, I do so with a heart\nbrimming with gratitude for the opportunities for growth and self-discovery it has provided.\nI wholeheartedly recommend this program to all young individuals seeking a transformative journey\nthat transcends the ordinary. This program, which blends leadership development with the thrill of\nmaritime adventure, has the power to shape not only your future but also your character.\nWith wind in my sails, I eagerly anticipate the next adventure, wherever it may lead.\nJoanna Mahuru\n"

Everyone worked so well together, and there was always someone there when\nyou needed it. It was a very supportive place, and no one really judged. The learning was amazing,\nand the content was entirely maximised, with every opportunity to learn taken into account. I was\nimpressed with how many methods were used to teach, weather it was visual, audible or practical.\nThe food onboard was so much better than I had expected, and I quickly came to love mealtimes\nalmost as much as bedtime!\nWhat have you learned? Discipline and appreciation for the small things for sure, but also some\nlarger things like social skills and responsibilities, and a voice of leadership.

When we came, we were parted into groups, red\n(known by \u201cmedium stay\u201d), white (known by \u201cslay\u201d), and blue (the singing group). I was Blue. We\nlearned about safety and how the toilet worked. The first night on our night watch, we came up with\npersonal and group coals. One of mine was to see a whale.\nWe started getting into the routine. Waking up at 0000 or 0400, when we were eating and flush the\ntoilet for 30 sec. When we Saturday sailed out of Devenport port it was with excitement among all\nof us. The first 24 hours was probably the worst, many spewed and felt sick but after that we were\nall ready for the adventure.\nEach day we had morning brief where we had our rope races.

We saw dolphins glowing in\nthe water. I saw the Milky Way and I don\u2019t think I have ever seen so many stars. It was such a\nmagnificent wonder. And I got to see some really beautiful nature along the Tasmania east coast.\nI was asked a week before if I wanted to go on this trip, so I hadn\u2019t given myself the time to make\nthe big expectations. But it was so much more than the things I had thought about. I had thought I\nwas going to be sicker, but it was a pretty short period of time for me. And I actually thought it\nwould be worse going ashore than it was. I didn\u2019t swing as much as I expected.\nWhat have I learned? It could take the hole day to write it all down. I have learned to tie knots, set\nsails, steer a ship, there is much more behind the surface than I know, be curious, how much\nphones distract us, how easy it is to make friends when you live with them, a lot more about\nTasmania, some people are just amazing, don\u2019t take things for granted, the world is beautiful and a\nlot more things.\nMy watch became like a family to me. We ate together. We were up at 2am doing watch together.\nWe cleaned the ship together. And we just had fun together. We became known as the singing\nwatch. And that was often mentioned in our wakie wakie songs. Which is always a good way to\nwake up. The singing was a good way to keep me awake in the long hours doing the night. And I\u2019m\ngrateful for our watch-leader Aaron for making it a lot more fun. I\u2019m actually unaware of how the\nother watches did it without him.

There was also no\ntechnology allowed so in their spare time away from their mobile phones the girls found they\nreached out to connect with others and forge new friendships.\nLifelong Yachtsman and Brisbane-to-Gladstone Yacht Race competitor David Taylor said the Rotary\nclubs in Gladstone sponsor the young people and Rotary help the kids to raise money to put\ntowards their trip. \u201cThe voyages are a great opportunity for youth development and for a kid to have\n"

They learn to trust each other, communicate clearly, and cooperate to\nachieve common goals.\nEnvironmental Awareness: Sailing fosters a deep appreciation for the natural environment. Participants\nlearn about wind patterns, tides, marine life, and the importance of preserving marine ecosystems. This\nawareness often translates into a sense of environmental stewardship and responsibility.\nPhysical Fitness and Well-being: Sailing requires physical exertion, such as pulling ropes and\nmaneuvering sails, which promotes physical fitness and coordination. Spending time outdoors on the\nwater also promotes mental well-being and reduces stress.\nResilience and Adaptability: Weather conditions on the water can change rapidly, requiring participants\nto adapt their strategies and plans accordingly. This fosters resilience and the ability to remain calm and\nfocused in unpredictable situations.\nCultural and Social Awareness: Many sailing programs involve interaction with diverse groups of people,\nwhether it's fellow participants, instructors, or individuals in ports of call. This exposure helps broaden\ncultural understanding and social skills.\nGoal Setting and Achievement: Setting sail towards a destination and reaching it requires planning,\nperseverance, and determination. Youth learn to set achievable goals, break them down into manageable\nsteps, and celebrate their accomplishments.\nCareer and Educational Opportunities: Sailing can open doors to careers in marine industries, such as\nsailing instruction, marine biology, maritime law, or naval architecture. It can also enhance college\napplications and scholarship opportunities, demonstrating a well-rounded skill set and personal\ndevelopment.\nLife-Long Passion: Many participants develop a life-long love for sailing and the ocean. It becomes a\nhobby they can pursue throughout their lives, providing ongoing opportunities for recreation, relaxation,\nand personal growth.\n"

She was donated to the Windeward Bound Foundation Ltd by the family of\nthe late Ron Burton to be used as a training \"tool\" for young Australians.\nThanks to Tasmanian State Government support, Mistral II\u2019s restoration is being completed by energetic\ngroups of young people who are part of the MISTRAL (Multi Industry Skills Training Reaching All Levels)\nprogram. This program provides valuable workplace skills and training to young Tasmanians who have\nbeen unemployed for a long period, so they can go on to further training or enter the workforce.\nOnce restored Mistral II will join her sister ship, the STV Windeward Bound, in offering life-changing youth\ndevelopment Adventure Under Sail programs to young Australians. We're so proud to be the custodians\nof Mistral II and we look forward to seeing her out on the blue water once more.\nGETTING MISTRAL II TO HOBART\nThe story began when the head of the donor family, Barbara Burton, contacted our Managing Trustee\nand advised her of the family\u2019s desire to donate Mistral II in order to see her both preserved, and used to\ndevelop the future prospects of young Australians. A thorough inspection of the vessel was then carried\nout by Captain Sarah Parry and one of her Tall Ship colleagues, Jon Simpson. Having spent several days\ngoing over the entire inside of the hull, pricking and poking into every surface, it was decided to accept\nthe challenge, and bring her to Hobart, firstly for restoration and secondly as a future adjunct to our youth\ndevelopment programs.\nWhile Sarah began exploring the development of a future program, Jon managed to cement an\nagreement with a shipping company that had one of their ships calling into Sydney for fuel whilst on their\nway to Hobart. However, time was short, the window of opportunity was narrow. A cradle to support\nMistral II was required. Barbara Burton made contact with a family friend, a structural engineer, David\nHall, who agreed to design the 8 tonne steel cradle. Having done so, Barbara contracted with a\nfabricator to build the cradle. The cradle was so large it had to be de-mountable to transport it to the\nwharf area\u2026.. We then had to wait for the ship to arrive at Sydney. The weeks sped past, the ship was\nheld up by cargo problems in various ports and several potential loading dates came and went.\n"

Enter the Royal Australian Navy to the rescue. We discovered that\nthe Navy\u2019s Heavy Lift Transport ship HMAS CHOULES was coming to Hobart from Sydney for the Royal\nHobart Regatta and the My State Bank Australian Wooden Boat Festival. We submitted a request under\nthe Defence Assistance for Civilian Communities program which was, in due course, approved. The\nCommanding Officer of HMAS CHOULES, Commander Scott Houlihan and his team enthusiastically\nembraced the challenge, agreeing to carry Mistral II, her cradle and two shipping containers of equipment\nto Hobart with them.\n"

Mistral II has a way to go\nbefore she is ready to put to sea again, however, we at Windeward Bound saw a magnificent\ntraining opportunity. Our Managing Trustee immediately set to pen and paper and wrote a synopsis\nfor a training program incorporating the un-restored Mistral and at the same time, attracting some\nnecessary funding to enable it to happen.\nThe MISTRAL program aims to provide young people, particularly those who have been\nunemployed long term, with the very necessary understanding of workplace protocols and\nworkplace behaviour. You see, if you\u2019ve never worked in a proper workplace, how do you know\nwhat is expected of you. You can be trained to the nth degree, but still not be recognised for your\nknowledge and skill levels, because you simply have never had the opportunity to learn.\nWe put the MISTRAL program into action in 2020, after obtaining significant funding from the\nTasmanian Government\u2019s Department of State Growth Work Pathways program. This funding will\nallow us to take two intakes, each of 9 \u201cwork ready but not job ready\u201d young Tasmanians, aged\nnominally between 18 and 25 yo, working normal \u201cjob hours\u201d in a structured working environment,\nwith a full-time shipwright as facilitator and instructor. Our first group finished in early 2020 and we\nare aiming for the second group to begin in early 2021.\nThe work to be done is both complex and interesting, and it can be emotionally and psychologically\nrewarding. It will provide more than a normal workplace, in that it will have its challenges and its\nrewards. It will also provide an avenue for the participants to increase and/or hone their skills by\nbeing able to participate in a large number of short courses provided by either TasTAFE or Seafood\n& Maritime Training, or both. Both organisations have agreed to sponsor short courses that will\nbenefit either individuals, or the group. Young trainees also participate in a 10-day Windeward\nBound Youth Development voyage at the beginning their particular program, to boost their\nself-esteem and create a closer bond within the group.\nThe training program will use the same principals as those applied to Windeward Bound\u2019s Sail\nTraining and Youth Development programs and will also see an increase in participant\u2019s self esteem,\n"

The\nentire internal hull framing has been repaired which entailed the whole or partial replacement of some 110\nof the 140 frames. New frames, or partial frames, from the best Tasmanian Bluegum, have been cut,\nfitted, fastened above the waterline, faired off and sealed with Epoxy 2 pack Wood Preserver and Timber\nSealer, which is supplied as part of Wattyl\u2019s sponsorship. All the timber for the 38 new deckbeams, and\nthe total replacement of the SheerClamps and Beam shelves has been sourced, machined and readied\nfor lamination.\nThe trainees continue to be of core value to the project, they proved themselves as very capable and\nhave reached a level where they are able to make frame templates, mark out the curved and beveled\nframes and adjust the bandsaw for the required bevels, cut the frame and adjust it for an accurate fit\nagainst the planking.
